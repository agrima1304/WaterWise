We have created a website that helps users track their household water usage, as well as inform them of their water wastage as well as carbon emissions. 

How we will track their usage: The user can either manually input their data from their water meter and then upload a picture of their water meter to verify, alternatively they have the option of connecting to their smart home devices, which will automate the tracking and make the process more efficient.

Informing users of their water wastage: we have collected data and processed it to calculate national water usage averages dependant on number of users in a household. We then use this data to inform users if their household is above or below the average. If it is above the average, the website will give personalised tips to help them reduce water wastage, and if it is below the average, they earn points on the leaderboard.

The leaderboard: A fun, interactive way to promote healthy competition between users in the same area. The users in the top 5 of the leaderboard at the end of each calendar month are rewarded with incentives such as retail giftcards or grocercy coupons. If the user is able to consecutively for six months able to cut down on water wastage, they will get a minor discount on their next bill.

Plans for the future: We hope to expand our influence by incorportating decreasing carbon emissions into our company ethos.
